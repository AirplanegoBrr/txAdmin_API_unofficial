login system uses cookies
Status needs to use cookies to get Status

live console (consoles) uses cookies + socket.io
POSTs to the server then GETS (bad way of doing but it could be how socket.io does stuff? )
Will have to look into socket.io code :( (in ./scripts)
room = liveconsole

idiots have ALL socket code in the HTML :( (line 725)

Ended up using socket.io! We didnt have to use all post requesrs!! very happy!

Working on resorces

restart just runs start command (ensure_res)

stop uses stop_res
