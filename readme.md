# txAdmin API

txAdmin doesnt have an API so I made one!

This is very new! and some stuff is a little messy and not fully added!

Im still working on the following:

[ ] View CFG

[ ] Start, Restart, Stop the server (this is almost done I just need to add it)

[ ] Start, Restart, Stop the resorces (this is the same)

[ ] Auto CFG formater (so you dont need to format it)

txAdmin devs if your reading this PLEASE don't change ur API to much :)
