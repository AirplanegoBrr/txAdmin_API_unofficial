# [txAdmin](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin) API - NOT TESTED PAST 2022-20XX

[txAdmin](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin) doesnt have an API so I made one!

This is very new! and some stuff is a little messy and not fully added!

Im still working on the following:

- [ ] View CFG

- [ ] Start, Restart, Stop the server (this is almost done I just need to add it)

- [ ] Start, Restart, Stop the resorces (this is the same)

- [ ] Auto CFG formater (so you dont need to format it)

[txAdmin](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin) devs if your reading this PLEASE don't change ur API to much :)

I wont be adding any easy player managment (as you can just run commands) but if people ask for it I will add it (this is for the following: Whitelist, ban, kick)

Player IDs and stuff are given by status just an FYI
